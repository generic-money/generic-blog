# Introducing Generic Protocol - neutral infrastructure for private and yield-generating stablecoins

::authors

Stablecoins are booming, but liquidity and UX are getting more fragmented. The issue is structural, due to an outdated economic setup where issuers capture yield, while everyone else carries the cost by supporting integrations and liquidity across a growing set of competing dollars. The result is a market that grows without improving the user experience. We believe the solution to this is a neutral aggregation layer that unifies the most secure existing assets and pairs universal liquidity with opt-in privacy while routing yield to the distribution layer, so onchain dollars become fungible and frictionless in practice.

In short, we enable networks and apps to have their native onchain dollar with opt-in privacy and yield economics favouring them and their users over an issuer.

To ensure Generic fulfils its ambitious mission, we will be working with the best partner line up. GUSD, Generic's first deployment is built together on Ethereum with [Steakhouse Financial](https://www.steakhouse.financial/) on top of [Morpho](https://morpho.org/) as the yield source. The initial set of backing assets include Sky's USDS alongside USDT and USDC. We are also partnering with [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) to make GUSD accessible across the EVM ecosystem and beyond and to ensure seamless integration of the yield into incentive initiatives of our clients we collaborate with [Merkl](https://merkl.xyz/) and [Aragon](https://www.aragon.org/).

We are also excited to announce the first adopters bringing GUSD to their communities: [StatusL2](https://status.network/) (who helped ideate the product), [Taiko](https://taiko.xyz/), [Citrea](https://citrea.xyz/), and [Tempo](https://tempo.xyz/).

## Generic's neutral-first design:
- Opt-in privacy, across both transactions and balances, depending on a user's needs.
- Direct onchain yield sourcing, removing the overhead and friction of offchain issuance
- Unified collateral layer with backing in USDC, USDT and USDS, inheriting the liquidity and security of the most adopted assets
- Protocol neutrality, removing issuer economic capture, ensuring yield seamlessly feeds into distribution and growth.

We're designing Generic as a protocol-first, neutral infrastructure layer that minimises offchain dependencies and avoids issuer counterparties. It allows distribution rails to own the yield generated by the capital they onboard, without the administrative overhead, counterparty risk, or liquidity siloes inherent to issuer-led models. And because privacy is built into the protocol, the final outcome is an onchain dollar that behaves like a single, fungible dollar across the stack.

This is only the beginning and we are launching soon! Generic has an incredibly open design space and the best partners — if you'd like to build with us, get in touch at generic@generic.money
